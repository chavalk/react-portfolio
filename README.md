# react-portfolio

## Description

React Portfolio is an application built entirely with React.js. It involved taking an earlier version of my portfolio website built with HTML5 and CSS3 and building it from the ground up with React.js. Under the hood, the application has a pages folder for the about page, the portfolio page, and the contact page. It also takes advantage of using components in react to have a component for the nav bar, a component for the footer, and a component for building the project cards. The application uses React HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter in order to allow the deployment to GitHub pages. HashRouter is the one that facilitates rendering the different pages.

Below is a screenshot of the about page in the application:
